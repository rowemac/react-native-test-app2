# Guess A Number Game

This repo, built in React Native, features a game to be played on both iOS and Android devices through the Expo framework as part of the [Udemy React Native Course](udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/learn/lecture/13914812#overview) taught by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximilian-schwarzmueller/). A user chooses a number, and then the computer will make a guess as to which number was picked. If incorrect, the user will then utilize greater-than or less-than buttons that narrow the guessing algorithm until the correct number is guessed, at which point the game ends. 

## Installation

### Expo CLI
* Open a terminal or a command line interface
* Run `npm install --global expo-cli`

To view your app, the fastest way is to download the Expo Go app to your iOS or Android device
* [Android Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
* [iOS App Store](https://itunes.com/apps/exponent)
* Once installed on your device, go to the "Profile" tab if you have registered and your device will be rememebered, and all subsequent projects can be seen in the "Projects" tab
* You can also fire up the app by opening the camera on your device and focusing on the QR code in the bottom left corner of the IDE

### Running Expo with Device Simulators
Another way to view the app is to download device simulators that update in real time on your computer, which requires separate installation.
